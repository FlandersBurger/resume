The simplicity to set up a running server with Node is quite frankly astonishing and the ease of adding community written plugins still amazes me on a daily basis. Currently I have 4 node apps running, 2 externally facing that have helped me automate various processes, including an app that made it possible to download software prevously only available via CD.<br>I've used a lot of plugins so far, the most notable ones would be: <ul><li><strong>Tedious</strong> To make SQL connections easy</li><li><strong>Sequelize</strong> To make SQL queries using JS syntax</li><li><strong>Mongoose</strong> To make
        query MongoDB</li><li><strong>IIS Node</strong> To run node apps in IIS</li><li><strong>Nodemailer</strong> Simple SMTP package to make mailing easy</li><li><strong>Gulp</strong> To make development a breeze</li></ul>A full mastery of Node is impossible; I learn new things every time I use it and I am eager to keep learning it.",

By 12th grade we were required to read novels and do book reports on them, debate with classmates on various subjects and do an oral exam. Even though at the time it didn't seem like a great thing, I later landed a job for Nestle tech support (HP) in Dublin which only served French-speaking users while all my colleagues were also French. Crazily enough, I learned a vast amount of technical and colloquial French in an English speaking country. This skill comes in very handy in Canada as I can write manuals and user interfaces in both official languages (and which I am not a stranger too). Although I am getting rustier again at French due to not having used it in a while, it still comes in handy when a French-speaking customer is having trouble.",
