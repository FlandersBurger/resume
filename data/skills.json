The simplicity to set up a running server with Node is quite frankly astonishing and the ease of adding community written plugins still amazes me on a daily basis. Currently I have 4 node apps running, 2 externally facing that have helped me automate various processes, including an app that made it possible to download software prevously only available via CD.<br>I've used a lot of plugins so far, the most notable ones would be: <ul><li><strong>Tedious</strong> To make SQL connections easy</li><li><strong>Sequelize</strong> To make SQL queries using JS syntax</li><li><strong>Mongoose</strong> To make
        query MongoDB</li><li><strong>IIS Node</strong> To run node apps in IIS</li><li><strong>Nodemailer</strong> Simple SMTP package to make mailing easy</li><li><strong>Gulp</strong> To make development a breeze</li></ul>There is always new stuff to learn in relation to Node and I am eager to keep learning it.",

    "description": "Growing up in a small bilingual country with a non-common mother tongue, getting a second language is mandatory. By 12th grade we were required to read novels and do book reports on them, debate with classmates on various subjects and do an oral exam. Even though at the time it didn't seem like a great thing, I later landed a job for Nestle tech support (HP) in Dublin which only served French-speaking users while all my colleagues were also French. Crazily enough, I learned a vast amount of technical and colloquial French in an English speaking country. Although I am getting rustier again at French due to not having used it in a while, it still comes in handy when a French-speaking customer is having trouble.",

I have been able to use SQL server to automate a plethora of processes saving countless hours of manual work and weeding out errors made by it: automating emailed orders, calling APIs to auto-process orders, getting form data from wordpress, adding tarriffed item counts to UPS labels, calculating US customs dues, sending packing slips to third party warehouses, auto-enrolling supply chain customers,.... I've received a substantial <strong>CEO award</strong> in 2015 for building a report that allowed users to correlate any 2 attributes of sales to show trending. I've set up a couple of SQL databases from scratch to use for various reasons: APIs, SSRS reporting cubes, Automated order processing and am savvy in creating all aspects of a new database (keys, procedures, functions, relationships, backups, jobs,...)",
