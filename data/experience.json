The client side relies on Angular for the flow and feel of the app while Bootstrap and Font Awesome provide the look.

I revamped all the reports he had made to make them more efficient and created datasources, datasets, SQL jobs, datacubes, procedures, function, keys and every other SQL magic I had picked up in college. I guess I ended up excelling in what they had initially set out for me to do as a few months later I was awarded the CEO award out of the blue in a company-wide meeting. I was promoted to Software & Data Analyst an had officially taken on all reporting and programming. This sparked a project whereby I would make company-wide metrics and KPI's to be used to make corporate decisions and improve internal processes. As a result I maintained over 250 reports coupled with an intricate web of SQL processes to make sure they run as fast as possible with accurate u-to-date data.",

      "story": "My time at Imprint Plus started on the phone supporting customers with designing and printing their name badges. My knack for troubleshooting, my customer service experience, my unquenchable thirst for knowledge and my programming degree quickly catapulted me into more involved positions. SQL Server proved my first stepping stone, I created reports using SSRS that management had never seen before. Reports that allowed them to correlate any values on the fly showing them trends they didn't know were there. After I was dubbed Software & Data Analyst I started tackling legacy systems that were in dire need of upgrading: automating faxed, ftp'd and emailed orders from different customers into one unified system, creating a new web app from scratch to replace a java applet and completely revamping how tech support was handled and making it as smooth of a process as possible amongst a plethora of random small improvements all around. It is hard to deny that my programming tendrils will be felt long after I leave. Aside from programming, my role required me to meet with high profile customers to find solutions that worked for them, whether it be how they would place their orders or how they would print their badges. Amongst others, I've directly helped bring in customers like: 7-11, Best Buy, Hudson Bay Company, Stage Stores, Zales, Sprint, Lego, Rite-Aid and Ulta."

      "story": "I was initially hired at BC Hydro for a computer / operating system upgrade (from Win XP to Win 7). I travelled around the lower mainland to BC Hydro locations (mostly alone) to upgrade the users and accomodate their previous setups on their new environment, some of which included dual boot systems with legacy DOS programs, a challenge to say the least but challenges are there to be stared in the face. It required me to think on my feet a lot as the job was usually of hours without extra support on-site with heavily costumized computers (think engineering). The job evolved to a tier 2 tech support position as the upgrade project slowly came to an end. The tier 2 position was your standard support job: end user hardware/software support"
